- Parts of the brain that ‘activate’ when people stop concentrating on a specific, external task
- One might think this is a resting state, but the brain is not less active.
	- This can explain the idea of shower thoughts
- I think of this as 'active' thinking versus 'passive' processing
	- e.g., actively sitting at your desk with a calculator working on a math problem vs. passively mulling it over while on a walk
	- Active thinking can hit a wall while passive processing runs in the background
- However, if we're always in an active thinking mode, we never receive the benefits of the default mode network
	- As [[Cal Newport]] mentions in [[Digital Minimalism]],[^2] people, especially generations that grew up with smartphones, are so adverse to boredom that we never access the default mode network.
- [[Dan Koe]] suggests a three part daily routine[^1] in which you fill you mind with information, empty it with things that activatve the default mode like exercise or [[Mindfulness|mindfulness]] practices, and then create using your mind to put everything to use.

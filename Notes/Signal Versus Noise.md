> The Signal and the Noise: Why Most Predictions Fail – but Some Don't (alternatively stylized as The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail – but Some Don't) is a 2012 book by Nate Silver detailing the art of using probability and statistics as applied to real-world circumstances. The book includes case studies from baseball, elections, climate change, the 2008 financial crash, poker, and weather forecasting.

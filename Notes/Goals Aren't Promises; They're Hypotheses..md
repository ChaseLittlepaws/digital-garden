- Similar to the idea that it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. As the Forte quote points out, setting a goal is more about learning from experience than actually achieving the goal. 
- Viewing a goal more as a hypothesis can help you feel both invested and detached; You can be interested in seeing the outcome and following through, but also not disappointed when something doesnâ€™t go as planned.

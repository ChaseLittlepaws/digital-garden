In this digital garden blog, I tag some notes with a 'Paradigms' tag. These notes are about groups of ideas, such as areas within a field of study. For example, [[Positive Psychology]] or [[Digital Minimalism]]. Paradigms are made up of groups of [[Meta - Ideas|Idea notes]] to create a greater whole. Both Paradigms and Ideas have [[Meta - Thinkers|Thinkers]] who think and distribute information about these topics.

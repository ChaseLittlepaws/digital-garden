- A core tenant of [[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM]] paradigms like [[Building a Second Brain]] and [[Zettelkasten]].
- According to [[Dan Allosso]] in *How to Make Notes and Write*[^1], the best way to discover and articulate what we think about a topic or resource is to write about it.
	- Some of this writing may only be useful to use, but others may benefit from sharing these notes as well, i.e., [[Learning in Public|the practice of learning in public]].
	- Writing about anything is a three-way dialogue between the writer, the reader, and the material itself.
	- We learn by writing; That is, we take information from short term memory and create something with it, putting it into long term memory. 
		- If we can't write something in our own words, we probably don't really understand it.

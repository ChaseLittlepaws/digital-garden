- Originally read in [[Dan Allosso]]'s book *How to Make Notes and Write*[^1]
	- Written in reference to the ways that we all have pre-existing information that is the basis of any research that we do.
		- In a more negative interpretation, we also start any project with pre-existing biases
	- “Standing on the shoulders of giants”
		- We don't own our ideas, and it's very rare to have a completely original thought
		- The main originality most modern students and scholars work with is an creative combination of ideas. This is emphasized by those in the [[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM]] space
			- Therefore, collecting as much relevant information as possible maximizes the chance on creating an original / creative connection.
				- Allosso explains this as "transferring the ownership" of iddeas to ourselves.
	- Information, like [[Meta - Ideas|Idea notes]], that isn't connected with other 'external scaffolding' we have is likely to be lost.
		- We need to situate our work within the context of our existing knowledge

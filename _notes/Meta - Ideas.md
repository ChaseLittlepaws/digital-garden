In this digital garden blog, some notes are tags 'Ideas.' These notes contain concepts that, while part of a greater whole, can stand alone. This is similar to the idea of atomic notes[^1] in the [[Zettelkasten]] space. Groups of related Ideas often make up [[Meta - Paradigms|Paradigms]]. Both Paradigms and Ideas have [[Meta - Thinkers|Thinkers]] who think and distribute information about these topics.

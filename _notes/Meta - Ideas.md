In this digital garden blog, some notes are tags 'Ideas.' These notes contain concepts that, while part of a greater whole, can stand alone. This is similar to the idea of atomic notes[^1] in the [[Zettelkasten]] space. Groups of related Ideas often make up [[Meta - Paradigms|Paradigms]]. Both Paradigms and Ideas have [[Meta - Thinkers|Thinkers]] who think and distribute information about these topics.

Regarding the atomicity of notes, [[Dan Allosso]] says that writing separate notes for each discrete idea both enhances organization and also helps notetakers to develop the habit of writing in concise, plain language. Allosso also notes that single-idea notes are easier to mix and match with other ideas in a [[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM system]], and that Idea notes (he calls them point notes), should be immediately linked to an existing note when added to the system.
